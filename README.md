- npm or yarn package manager

### Installation

1. **Clone or create the project**:
   ```bash
   mkdir backtracking-visualizer
   cd backtracking-visualizer
   ```

2. **Initialize a new React project**:
   ```bash
   npx create-react-app . --template minimal
   ```

3. **Install required dependencies**:

   ```

4. **Install Tailwind CSS**:
   ```bash
   npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
   npx tailwindcss init -p
   ```

5. **Configure Tailwind CSS** in `tailwind.config.js`:
   ```javascript
   module.exports = {
     content: [
       "./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}",
     ],
     theme: {
       extend: {},
     },
     plugins: [],
   }
   ```

6. **Add Tailwind directives** to `src/index.css`:
   ```css
   @tailwind base;
   @tailwind components;
   @tailwind utilities;
   ```

7. **Replace the contents of `src/App.js`** with the provided PuzzleSolver component code.

8. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

9. **Open your browser** and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

## üéÆ How to Use

2. **Adjust Speed**: Use the speed slider to control animation timing
3. **Start Solving**: Click the "Solve" button to begin visualization
4. **Watch the Algorithm**: Observe as queens are placed and backtracked
5. **View Statistics**: Monitor steps taken and backtracks in the stats panel

### Sudoku Solver
1. **Choose Difficulty**: Select Easy, Medium, Hard, or create a blank puzzle
2. **Edit Mode** (Optional): Click "Edit Puzzle" to create custom puzzles
   - Click any cell to enter numbers 1-9
   - Leave cells empty (0) for the algorithm to solve
   - Click "Apply Changes" when finished editing
3. **Start Solving**: Click "Start Solving" to begin visualization
4. **Speed Control**: Adjust animation speed with the slider
5. **Monitor Progress**: Watch the algorithm fill cells and backtrack when needed

## üß† Algorithm Details

### Backtracking Process
The visualizer demonstrates the core backtracking algorithm:

1. **Place/Try**: Attempt to place a piece or number at the current position
2. **Validate**: Check if the placement satisfies all constraints
3. **Recurse**: If valid, move to the next position and repeat
4. **Backtrack**: If invalid or no solution found, undo the placement and try the next option
5. **Complete**: Continue until solution is found or all possibilities are exhausted

### N-Queens Constraints
- No two queens can be in the same row
- No two queens can be in the same column  
- No two queens can be on the same diagonal

### Sudoku Constraints
- Each row must contain digits 1-9 exactly once
- Each column must contain digits 1-9 exactly once
- Each 3√ó3 box must contain digits 1-9 exactly once

## üé® Visual Elements

### Color Coding
- **N-Queens**: 
  - Light amber squares for the chessboard
  - Red squares with crown icons for placed queens
  
- **Sudoku**:
  - Gray squares for original puzzle clues
  - Blue animated squares for algorithm-filled numbers
  - Yellow hover effects in edit mode

### Statistics Panel
Both algorithms display:
- **Steps Taken**: Total number of placement attempts
- **Backtracks**: Number of times the algorithm had to undo moves
- **Current Status**: Ready, Solving, or Solved

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Built With
- **React**: Frontend framework with hooks (useState, useEffect)
